# TML&mdash;Experiments in topological machine learning

This repository contains some of my experiments in topological machine
learning. At present, the following things are here:

- Persistence diagrams for all of Shakespeare's plays
- Kernel matrices and distances matrices for...
    - persistence indicator functions
    - Wasserstein matchings
- Basic classifier code

You need Python and `scikit-learn` to run the experiments in this
repository. In order to reproduce the results of this blog post, you
it should be sufficient to call

    ./run_comparison.sh

from the main directory of this repository.

I hope to populate this repository with more results and more
applications in order to show the benefits of topological methods in
machine learning.

Feel free to contact me for discussions & requests!
